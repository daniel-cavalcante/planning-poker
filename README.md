# planning-poker

A planning/scrum/agile poker APP developed by me. This is my first project used to learn new technologies.
On the client-side, I have used React (very popular choice), while on the back-end I have used node+express and mongoDB to store the room's info.
Here are some pictures.

Here is how you can run this project on your localserver:

    Start a MongoDB server to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017.
    On a terminal with node installed, change directory to the server folder and run 'npm start' (don't forget to run 'npm install' beforehand).
    On a second terminal, change the directory to the client folder and run 'npm start' (don't forget to run 'npm install' beforehand).
    On your browser, simply access 'http://localhost:3000/' and voil√°.
